# Development

* [URLs](urls.md) 

## Routes

Routes are defined in `config/routes.yaml`

These define the URL path to match and the controller / action to run.

At present routes are manually created in Symfony.  

See https://symfony.com/doc/current/routing.html

## Controllers

Controllers are saved in `src/Controller/`
