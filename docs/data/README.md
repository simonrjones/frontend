# Accessing data

You can access data either via repository classes or by making direct data requests via data providers.

## Repositories

Repositories make it easier to get data from specific data sources. They are basically wrappers around data providers and 
offer the same functionality with additional helpers to do things like setup authentication and map data automatically 
to content objects.

* WordPress (currently broken - fix in progress)

## Data providers

Repositories use data providers to access data. You can use them directly too.

The basic principle is make a request to an API, then either decode the response to an array or map it to an object.
