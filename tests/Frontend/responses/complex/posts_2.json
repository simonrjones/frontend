          "content": "<p>Last night (11th December 2018) UK Parliament passed new legislation banning the sale of virtually all ivory products, regardless of age. The ban, which Fauna &amp; Flora International (FFI) had called for, is one of the toughest in the world. It will come into force at least six months after receiving royal assent, which is expected next week.</p>\n<p>FFI welcomes this measure because the legal supply of ivory is fuelling demand and providing cover for illegal ivory trade. Many conservation organisations, including FFI, have long argued for the closure of domestic markets. This action by the UK will make law enforcement more straightforward, while also making it easier to reduce demand for ivory amongst consumers.</p>\n<p>FFI works to tackle elephant poaching in countries including Mozambique and Liberia. We are therefore acutely aware that there is still much work to do to stop poaching and protect elephants. Concerted, collaborative action is needed from all countries, each of which has a role to play. The closure of domestic ivory markets is a vital step, but it must be accompanied by other measures. These include addressing the ongoing challenges of poor governance, corruption and under-resourcing of the institutions responsible for enforcing wildlife regulations. It is also critical to build capacity and engage with communities living alongside elephants and other wildlife to enable locally led, sustainable conservation action.</p>\n<p>It is imperative that other countries, particularly those in Southeast Asia, now follow the UK’s lead and close their ivory markets.</p>\n",

Credit: FFI</figcaption></figure>\n<p>FFI’s founding father, Edward North Buxton, was a no-nonsense character. He had recently undertaken two trips to Africa and written a book about them entitled, appropriately enough, <em>Two African Trips</em>. This utilitarian approach to language extended to his choice of name for the organisation he was instrumental in establishing; the Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of the Empire doesn’t exactly trip off the tongue, but it did what it said on the tin, and the name is certainly redolent of the bygone colonial era during which it was founded.</p>\n<p>Paradoxically, FFI owes its existence to an assorted collection of big game hunters who realised that they were running out of things to shoot. The catalyst for its foundation was a petition, organised by Buxton, which successfully dissuaded the colonial authorities in the Sudan from opening up the vast, recently established White Nile Reserve to hunting.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20684\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-20684\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/raiders-of-the-lost-archive-episode-one-2.png\" alt=\"Charcoal portrait of Edward North Buxton, founding father of Fauna &amp; Flora International.

Credit: FFI</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Other founder members who shared Buxton’s concern that hunting of African game had reached unsustainable levels included Colonel J.H. Patterson, whose lion-killing heroics inspired a bestselling book – <em>The Man-Eaters of Tsavo</em> – and a trio of Hollywood films; Frederick Selous, the archetypal great white hunter, inspiration for the fictional Allan Quatermain and First World War hero-in-waiting; and the brewing magnate, Samuel Whitbread, who was anxious to avert an African version of the free-for-all that had led to the near-total wipeout of the American bison.</p>\n<p>In its original guise, FFI operated first and foremost as a pressure group that drew on its collective aristocratic muscle in order to lean on the colonial authorities. With this in mind, Buxton and his co-founders wasted no time in recruiting heavyweight friends as honorary members. Among them was President Theodore Roosevelt, an ardent conservationist whose love of nature did not preclude him from mounting an African hunting expedition during which over 11,000 animals were trapped or killed in the name of science.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20685\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-20685\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/raiders-of-the-lost-archive-episode-one-3.png\" alt=\"President Theodore Roosevelt and Frederick Selous riding from Mombasa to Nairobi en route to the infamous 1909-10 African safari.

However self-interested their motives may have been, they were nevertheless responsible for kick-starting the international wildlife conservation movement. And their pioneering efforts paved the way for the sophisticated, multifaceted global conservation network that we take for granted today.</p>\n<p>The derogatory label dreamed up by FFI’s early detractors proved to be spectacularly wide of the mark. Fast-forward to 1978, where we find FFI commemorating three-quarters of a century of conservation success with the publication of a short book, penned by honorary secretary Richard Fitter and illustrated by chairman Sir Peter Scott. Its tongue-in-cheek title was – you’ve guessed it – <em>The Penitent Butchers</em>.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20686\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-20686\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/raiders-of-the-lost-archive-episode-one-4.png\" alt=\"Detail from the cover of The Penitent Butchers, published in 1978 to commemorate FFI's 75th anniversary.

              "content": "<p>Forests contain the overwhelming majority of life on Earth, including a staggering 80% of the planet’s terrestrial species. From the humid tropical rainforests of the Amazon to the temperate treetops of the Pacific Northwest, forests are incredibly dynamic and diverse environments; they provide warmth, shelter, water and food, and so are havens for a multitude of plants and animals.</p>\n<p>But, while it can be easy to look at a forest and simply see ‘trees’, the incredible diversity of this plant group should not go unappreciated. There are over 60,000 different tree species in the world and natural forests can be made up of tens, hundreds or even thousands of different species.</p>\n<p>Broadly speaking, there are three types of forest: tropical forests, which are confined to a broad geographical band that straddles the equator; temperate forests with highly variable seasons, which paint the northern hemisphere in rich tones of gold, ochre and red as deciduous species shed their leaves in autumn; and boreal forests, also known as taiga, which grow in northerly latitudes and are dominated by evergreen conifers that can tolerate freezing cold and a blanket of snow for months on end.</p>\n<p>Many forests are so-called biodiversity hotspots – they are absolutely packed to the brim with life. Rainforests are the undisputed champions: a single square kilometre of Amazonian rainforest can harbour up to 100 different tree species, including 35-metre-tall giants encased in their own collection of vines, mosses and bromeliads. These towering titans and the fertile forest floor at their roots are a treasure trove of wildlife, from monkey-eating eagles and dazzling macaws to diminutive but deadly poison-dart frogs and a kaleidoscope of butterflies and other insects that fill the air like animated confetti.</p>\n<p>Temperate forests, meanwhile, are alive with arguably less exotic but nevertheless iconic species. Oak, elm, beech, cedar and maple trees are just a few species typical of these forests, standing amid common herbs and shade-loving wild flowers. Squirrels, weasels, deer, wolves, wild cats and bears all favour these wooded habitats, while birds of prey wheel overhead during the day, and badgers, bats and owls emerge at night.</p>\n<p>The boreal forest is a particularly challenging environment, and so biodiversity here is comparatively low but superbly adapted. The trees and other flora species tend to be particularly hardy (for example pine, fir, spruce, birch and aspen) and the fauna is equally so. Swarms of insects proliferate in the brief window of summer before vanishing abruptly. Migratory birds make themselves scarce after the short breeding season, while species that cannot relocate need to be adequately equipped to survive the extremes of winter. Some – like elk, wolves and the Eurasian lynx – grow a heavy winter coat. Others – such as boreal and great grey owls – rely on a thick quilt of feathers. Bears hibernate and beavers retreat to their lodge. Wood frogs have natural anti-freeze in their blood.</p>\n",

Enormous tracts of rainforest are being destroyed or degraded to accommodate human settlement, cattle ranching, oil palm plantations and other large-scale activities driven by the growing demands of our consumer society.</p>\n<p>The slow-growing boreal forests of the far north – Alaska, Canada, Russia – in turn are threatened by the oil and natural gas industries, since many such forests are thought to sit atop oil reserves, and are thus of interest to developers struggling to meet the demand for fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>Many forest-dependent species are uniquely adapted to their habitat and would struggle to survive outside this environment. Over 10,000 tree species are themselves threatened with extinction, and often the risks to a particular species are unique.</p>\n<p>Forest ecosystems are bound together in a set of mutually dependent relationships known collectively as an ecosystem, and any disruption to that system – whether small or dramatic – has a knock-on effect. At its most devastating, deforestation can result in a catastrophic loss of biodiversity.</p>\n<p>Healthy, intact forests are vital to our own survival, as well as that of the animal and plant species they harbour. We depend on them for the very air that we breathe, as well as for clean water, rich and stable soils, flood protection, timber, food and pharmaceutical ingredients. Forests also play a crucial role in combating global warming by absorbing carbon dioxide that would otherwise end up in the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Conversely, rapidly rising global temperatures are not only increasing the risk of catastrophic forest fires, but also threaten to alter the composition of forests across the globe, helping the more adaptable species to thrive while hindering others. This will upset the equilibrium of delicate forest ecosystems, further reducing their resilience to climate change and diminishing their carbon storage potential.</p>\n",

              "content": "<p>Fauna &amp; Flora International (FFI) has an extensive track record in forest protection dating back half a century. In past decades our work has focused predominantly on tropical rainforests in areas such as the Amazon basin, Ecuador’s Chocó rainforest, Central America, the Congo Basin and Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>More recently, our remit has broadened to encompass ecosystems as varied as West African rainforest, Portugal’s cork oak forests and the fruit-and-nut forests of Central Asia. We place particular emphasis on working with communities to ensure that they participate actively in – and benefit directly from – forest conservation initiatives in their own backyards.</p>\n<p>We are also acutely aware of the importance of taking a species-level approach as well as an ecosystem-level one in order to maintain the incredible diversity of tree species in the world. Despite the fact that one in six tree species is threatened with extinction, conservation effort to date has largely failed to consider trees as being in need of conservation management in their own right.</p>\n<p>In 1999, recognising this shortfall, FFI joined forces with Botanical Gardens Conservation International to establish the Global Trees Campaign, through which we have supported the conservation of more than 180 tree species in 29 countries to date.</p>\n<p>Other examples of FFI’s forest conservation work include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Safeguarding a viable corridor of <em>montado</em> (cork oak) forest to support the recovery of the critically endangered Iberian lynx</li>\n<li>Protecting the ancient fruit-and-nut forests of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, which harbour globally important biodiversity (including the critically endangered Bukharan pear and the endangered Niedzwetzky’s apple) and are vital for community livelihoods</li>\n<li>Working with our partners and indigenous communities in Belize to promote environmentally sustainable livelihoods that do not compromise the ecological integrity of forest corridors</li>\n<li>Piloting a community-based approach to forest conservation in Liberia using a mechanism (REDD+) that rewards people at grass-roots level for reducing carbon emissions by keeping their forests standing</li>\n<li>Securing greater protection for karst limestone forest ecosystems in northern Vietnam, which are home to some of the world’s most endangered primates and magnolias</li>\n</ul>\n",

Its landscapes range from rugged mountains and arid deserts to lush and fertile rainforests, and from cold, turbulent oceanic waters to roaring rivers to warm, crystal-clear tropical seas. The Neotropical realm (Central and South America and the Caribbean) in particular boasts some of the world’s richest areas for biodiversity, with 10% of the world’s species found in the Amazon Rainforest alone.</p>\n<p>This is the land of the jaguar, spectacled bear, ocelot and anaconda. Its tropical forests are decorated with brightly coloured birds such as toucans and macaws, while New World monkeys provide an atmospheric soundtrack as they call to one another in the treetops. The region is also critical for sea turtles, with leatherback, hawksbill and olive ridley turtles all coming ashore to nest here.</p>\n<p>The Caribbean, meanwhile, supports a richness of biodiversity that may be surprising to some. Its tropical coral reefs are teeming with life, and many of its islands are home to an array of species found nowhere else on Earth. Particularly startling is the level of reptile endemism, with 6% of the world’s reptiles found in the West Indies alone.</p>\n",

At the same time, other pressures such as climate change, overfishing, logging and poaching are also taking their toll on plant and animal species.</p>\n<p>In the Caribbean, invasive species have had a particularly devastating impact on native wildlife populations, with many island endemics – particularly reptiles – driven to extinction by alien rats and mongooses that were introduced to the islands by European settlers. According to one IUCN report, 75% of known vertebrate extinctions in recent history have taken place in the West Indies.</p>\n",

There’s a seahorse here!” As this excited cry sounded, a number of snorkellers converged on the spot, eager for a glimpse of one of these secretive and threatened creatures which lurk, perfectly camouflaged, amongst green blades of seagrass.</p>\n<p>The exciting search for seahorses happened as part of an exchange visit, with Fauna &amp; Flora International’s (FFI) marine team from Myanmar travelling to meet FFI Cambodia staff, government figures and community members in September 2018. Participants from both countries took the opportunity to share successes in their respective marine conservation projects, and swap ideas for potential solutions to ongoing issues.</p>\n<p>As part of their visit, six Myanmar representatives (some of whom were travelling abroad for the first time) participated in a snorkelling trip to see the seagrass meadows we are working with fishing communities to protect. Amongst many exciting species, including pipefish, jellyfish and hermit crabs, the seahorses were the favourite sighting. This was a particularly special moment for Cheata from FFI Cambodia and Muyar Aye from the Myanmar team, who were lucky enough to find a seahorse during their first ever snorkelling experience.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20480\" style=\"width: 1652px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-20480 size-full\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/bringing-marine-conservationists-and-communities-together-in-cambodia.jpg\" alt=\"Phallin from FFI Cambodia demonstrates SMART patrol techniques to Kyaw Zay Ya from the Myanmar team, with assistance from Mr Kem Ann of the Cambodian Fisheries Administration.

This momentous event brought the Myanmar and Cambodia marine teams together for the first time to learn lessons and improve connections between FFI’s focal countries for ocean conservation in Southeast Asia. Our Myanmar colleagues travelled from Yangon to Phnom Penh, Cambodia’s capital, before making the long drive south to the coast and hopping on a boat to reach FFI’s project sites, hidden in the picturesque surroundings of Koh Rong and Koh Rang Sanloem.</p>\n<p>During the visit, FFI staff were joined by representatives of the Cambodian Fisheries Administration, who kindly supported our activities and shared their experiences of fisheries management. Also in attendance were members of the Community Fisheries organisations supported by FFI to patrol and enforce local fishing areas in Koh Rong and another project site on the island of Koh Sdach.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20482\" style=\"width: 1565px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-20482\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/bringing-marine-conservationists-and-communities-together-in-cambodia-2.jpg\" alt=\"The exchange visit team accompanied the Prek Svay Community Fishery team during a patrol in the mangroves, and here they are in action.

Despite being situated in different countries and separated by hundreds of miles, the Myanmar team’s visit to Cambodia highlighted many similarities between the two programmes. Rampant illegal fishing, particularly from trawlers, is a major issue in both countries, jeopardising the livelihoods of local small-scale fishers and threatening diverse species and habitats, from seahorses and seagrass to turtles and coral reefs.</p>\n<p>New understanding of this and other shared problems presented opportunities for shared solutions, with FFI’s Phallin Chea demonstrating SMART patrol techniques to our Myanmar colleagues, including Kyaw Zayya who will be working to apply a similar approach in Myeik. Phallin showcased how Cambodian communities use technology and locally-based patrolling to keep an eye on their fishing grounds, reporting and deterring illegal activities. In turn, Soe Thiha, from the Myanmar team, shared best practice from a successful ‘crab bank’ pilot initiative in Myeik, with the aim of helping to overcome issues encountered during trials of similar concepts in Koh Rong.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20485\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-20485\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/bringing-marine-conservationists-and-communities-together-in-cambodia-3.png\" alt=\"The exchange visit team, with representatives of the Fisheries Administration, Prek Svay Community Fishery and FFI.

We look forward to hearing how new ideas are embraced and put into action as the teams return to their project sites. Finally, we thank Fondation Segre, Arcadia (a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin), the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation and the Fisheries Administration of Cambodia for their support of this hugely successful exchange visit.</p>\n",

About 71% of the Earth’s surface is covered in water, and a whopping 97% of this is found in our seas and oceans.</p>\n<p>However, we still know surprisingly little about this watery realm – so far, only 5% of our oceans have been explored. What we do know is that life under the waves is as rich, varied, and fascinating as life on land.</p>\n<p>The majority of marine life is concentrated along the continental shelves – the shallow waters surrounding the major land masses. Here, sunlight and nutrient upwellings create an ideal environment for plants and algae to thrive, which in turn support vast food chains from tiny zooplankton right up to the mighty blue whale: the largest animal ever to have lived on Earth.</p>\n<p>Around the tropics we find coral reefs, which are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet. Despite occupying just 1% of the seabed, these support more than a quarter of all marine life.</p>\n<p>Yet even if we venture out of these biodiversity hotspots, down into the deepest abysses or to the frigid waters of the poles, we still find an astonishing variety of life – much of it bizarre, and all of it extraordinary.</p>\n",

Back in 2016, when FFI suggested that one of its corporate partners in Africa should be thinking about its potential impact on illegal wildlife trade when planning a new project, the initial response was exasperation. The list of factors it was being asked to consider seemed to be getting longer by the day and, it insisted, the extractives business has nothing to do with illegal wildlife trade!</p>\n<p>We pointed out that the new project was close to populations of endangered primates, extremely close to one of the best-studied bushmeat trade centres in the region, and would potentially be responsible for bringing thousands of new faces into the area. An impact assessment was duly commissioned, which confirmed that hunting, poaching and trade were issues a major infrastructure company needed to factor into its planning.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_19519\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-19519 size-full\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hidden-costs-how-infrastructure-development-may-fuel-illegal-wildlife-trade-2.png\" alt=\"The critically endangered Grauer's gorilla, one of many species threatened by increased demand for bushmeat fuelled by the presence in the forest of large numbers of extractive industry employees.

Credit: Angelique Todd/FFI</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The development of large-scale infrastructure projects across the globe is one of the hottest topics in both conservation and finance. The arguments in favour of more infrastructure are strong, particularly in developing countries. 2.5 billion people lack access to basic sanitation; 1.3 billion have no electricity. Addressing these needs will require major investment. But the sheer scale of this, with US$70 trillion of new investment expected by 2030, raises concerns that speed is compromising quality.</p>\n<p>In Africa, for example, plans to create 53,000 kilometres of development corridors are likely to have major repercussions, particularly for the 2,200 protected areas that stand to be affected. Land clearance, increased access to sensitive habitats, pollution and a concentrated influx of people and money can all have serious environmental and social impacts, and the potential to directly undermine the stated development goals.</p>\n<p>Many of the companies responsible for leading these projects, and the development banks that finance them, do have rules and policies in place to minimise these risks. However, at a time when investment and potential impacts are reaching unprecedented levels, these essential safeguards are under increasing threat. Major companies, hit by falling commodity prices, have been accused of quietly backtracking on environmental and social commitments that may reduce profitability, while recent development bank reforms and revisions have been criticised for, at best, putting ease of implementation before effectiveness.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_19644\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19644\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hidden-costs-how-infrastructure-development-may-fuel-illegal-wildlife-trade-3.png\" alt=\"Access road cutting through pristine forest.

Whilst long recognised as a serious threat to low density, high-value species such as rhinos, elephants and tigers, wildlife trade has rarely featured as a priority outside the environmental world.</p>\n<p>But its wider implications have begun making headlines. Far from being ‘simply’ a threat to a few charismatic species, illegal wildlife trade is now irrefutably one of the world’s largest criminal industries. The high value of these products (rhino horn can fetch US$66,000 per kilo) coupled with historically low risk and complicated transboundary networks have combined to create a problem that is proving difficult to contain.</p>\n<p>Illegal trade is responsible not only for a significant proportion of all wildlife losses since 1970, but also for the spread of diseases, loss of ecosystem functionality and livelihoods, disruption of legal trade, major loss of tax revenue, increased corruption, weapons proliferation, money laundering and the undermining of national law and governance. As a result, illegal wildlife trade has risen rapidly up the political agenda. In recent years the UN, the World Bank, Interpol, the African and Asian Development Banks, President Obama and The Duke of Cambridge have all demonstrated their commitment to combating this growing scourge.</p>\n<p>The relationship between major infrastructure development and illegal wildlife trade is complex and poorly understood. There is evidence that such projects result in increased access to sensitive species and catalyse development of new trading routes, and that the influx of workers, families and associated businesses and cash can combine to boost both supply of, and demand for, illegal wildlife products. At the same time, they also contribute to improved prosperity, which can be one of the primary drivers of illegal wildlife trade unless measures are taken to avoid it.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_18538\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18538\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/being-smart-about-illegal-wildlife-trade-why-local-communities-matter-5.png\" alt=\"Illegal snare in Virunga National Park, DRC.

For a start, the impacts are rarely recognised, and are difficult to quantify. Furthermore, the arguments over accountability are open to debate. Is it fair to hold a company or bank responsible if their project successfully raises income levels in an area, but inadvertently stimulates demand for bush meat, or tiger parts for traditional medicine?</p>\n<p>As a result, few companies have specific policies that focus on minimising risk relating to illegal wildlife trade, even though many of the measures needed would be relatively simple and cheap to implement. Several development banks are actively involved in funding potential solutions to illegal wildlife trade, but few have safeguards that specifically address the potential risks of funding major infrastructure projects, despite the fact that these risks could directly undermine the very development goals they are mandated to pursue.</p>\n",

Future infrastructure development needs to be sustainable and it needs to be smart, particularly considering that the impacts will be felt for decades. Decisions need to take into account all of the benefits and all of the risks. Sacrifices and trade-offs will be required, but they need to be made based on complete information. Planning needs to be happening on an integrated, landscape scale, taking into account not only the financial cost-benefit analyses but also the direct, indirect and cumulative environmental and social impacts.</p>\n<p>Companies responsible for infrastructure projects need to recognise the scale of their impacts and behave more like national development partners than isolated businesses. They need not be held responsible for every indirect consequence of their presence, but they can minimise many of their impacts, such as those on illegal wildlife trade, through fairly simple actions and policies. Financial institutions, particularly development banks, need safeguards in place that allow development without compromising on risk management.

A close relative of the more familiar goliath frog – famed as the world’s largest – the Togo slippery frog is now believed to be restricted to the Togo-Volta Highlands, the forested hills that straddle the border between Ghana and Togo.</p>\n<p>It was here, in 2013, that Dr Caleb Ofori-Boateng and his CLP-funded project team embarked on a multi-pronged conservation effort to rescue this neglected and extremely rare amphibian from the brink of extinction. At this point, Caleb and his fellow frog enthusiasts were operating under the collective banner of Herp-Ghana. This organisation began life in 2006 as a small conservation interest group at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, but has since metamorphosed into a leading Ghanaian NGO that spearheads the conservation of amphibians and reptiles throughout West Africa.</p>\n<p>The team’s earlier CLP project, funded by a 2010 Future Conservationist Award, had focused on what was then considered to be the only viable population of the Togo slippery frog – in Ghana’s Atewa Mountains – which was threatened by habitat destruction as a result of bauxite mining, but recent research has revealed that this is almost certainly a completely different species.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20497\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-20497\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sanctuary-for-a-frog-on-the-slippery-slope-to-extinction-5.png\" alt=\"Caleb Ofori-Boateng conducting a forest survey.

Crucially, by engaging with a broad range of stakeholders – and with local communities in particular – Caleb and his colleagues played a pivotal role in building widespread support for the creation of the new protected area.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20495\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-20495 size-full\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sanctuary-for-a-frog-on-the-slippery-slope-to-extinction-4.png\" alt=\"Eliciting support for the new reserve among local communities.

Other species that share its dwindling forest habitat include the critically endangered hooded vulture, the endangered Ukami reed frog, the beleaguered black-bellied and white-bellied pangolins – victims of the rocketing demand for their scales in traditional Chinese medicine – and a veritable kaleidoscope of endemic butterflies.</p>\n<p>“It is a joy to see that so many species will now be saved alongside the slippery frog, thanks to this new reserve,” said Caleb. “The establishment of this new protected area is evidence that our conversation campaigns begun years ago with the support of CLP are finally bearing fruit.”</p>\n<p>CLP’s Executive Manager Stuart Paterson, who has followed this team’s progress with great interest since 2010, expressed his delight at the news: “After eight years of sustained work by this committed team, it is excellent to see that the area of land donated by the local community to protect Togo slippery frogs has expanded and received official recognition. Through perseverance and gaining support from a range of stakeholders – including, most importantly, local people – the team has made a big difference to the survival chances of this critically endangered frog.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20494\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-20494\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sanctuary-for-a-frog-on-the-slippery-slope-to-extinction-3.png\" alt=\"Togo slippery frog clinging to a rock in a forest stream.

Two isolated populations survive in afro-montane forest, one in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, south-western Uganda, and the other on the forested slopes of the Virunga volcanoes, straddling the borders of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda and Uganda. During the 20th century a combination of hunting and habitat destruction drove this very rare primate to the verge of extinction. Today, the species is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.",

This was the thought flowing through my mind when our boat came to a sudden stop. It turned out the engine was choking on a plastic sheet floating in the water. The boat driver pulled it out and threw it away with the attitude of someone who has to do this all the time.</p>\n<p>That mangroves trip was an appropriate start to my visit to Bali at the end of October. It is my work on <a href=\"https://www.fauna-flora.org/conservation-challenges/ocean-plastic-pollution\">ocean plastic pollution</a> that brought me to Indonesia for <a href=\"https://ourocean2018.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this year’s Our Ocean Conference</a>. Since 2014, this annual event has been generating hundreds of commitments and millions of dollars to protect the oceans from major threats. Unsurprisingly, plastic pollution has been a dominant theme at the conference in the last couple of years, with many big companies and nations announcing one passionate promise after another.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20439\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-20439\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-promises-our-ocean-needs-action-not-words.png\" alt=\"Mangroves tangled in plastic debris in Bali, Indonesia. \" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-promises-our-ocean-needs-action-not-words.png 2000w, https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-promises-our-ocean-needs-action-not-words-300x180.png 300w, https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-promises-our-ocean-needs-action-not-words-768x461.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mangroves tangled in plastic debris in Bali, Indonesia.

The optimism was due to the growing leadership from an increasing number of governments and corporates. The source of my frustration was the limited open discussion regarding follow up action. This is what triggered my scepticism about the real legacy of the grand statements – will such ambitious promises to our ocean lead to immediate – or indeed any – action towards solutions? For example, I was particularly excited to hear a commitment at last year’s Our Ocean from the UK Government to work on plastic pollution from pellet loss, given <a href=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FFI-Tackling-Plastic-Pellet-Loss-in-Your-Supply-Chain-.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FFI’s history of work on this issue </a>(pellets are the raw material of all plastic production and they are the second largest direct source of microplastics in the ocean, posing a major threat to wildlife). But as far as we know there has been no follow up to this commitment as yet.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Fantastic to hear the UK committing to support eliminating plastic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/nurdle?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#nurdle</a> loss through Operation Clean Sweep at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OurOcean?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#OurOcean</a> just now! <a href=\"https://t.co/WVLQfV7MxK\">pic.twitter.com/WVLQfV7MxK</a></p>\n<p>— Fauna &amp; Flora Int.

Firstly, I was genuinely encouraged by the intensified focus on reviewing progress against commitments that the Indonesian Government introduced as this year’s hosts. This could drive the much needed shift towards making the Our Ocean series a real catalyst for action. Additionally, I returned home with an extremely long list of public commitments and constructive in-person debates to follow up on. This conference has provided excellent, unprecedented opportunities to hold to account those directly responsible for the sources of the plastic pollution problem.</p>\n<p>For example, in answer to a question I posed from the floor, a representative from IKEA was able to share that they are in the process of auditing their plastic supply chain regarding emissions of plastic pellets into environment. Given that pellets leakage is the weak link in the ambitions for a circular plastics economy which many multinational companies have committed to achieve, it’s hard to believe that more brands like IKEA haven’t taken responsibility for the raw material sourcing behind the plastic products they sell. I find it fascinating that I still meet sustainability managers at big companies who don’t know what pellets are but know everything about where e.g., their fish or coffee beans are sourced from.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Update from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IKEA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@IKEA</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/pellet?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#pellet</a> loss just now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OurOcean2018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@OurOcean2018</a>: IKEA is aware that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/plastic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#plastic</a> pellets are leaking from supply chains into the ocean and brands have a responsibility to prevent this &#8211; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IKEA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@IKEA</a> has audited Tier 1 suppliers and recognises need for efforts further down the chain <a href=\"https://t.co/JHih6CtIyL\">pic.twitter.com/JHih6CtIyL</a></p>\n<p>— Marine Plastics (@marine_plastics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marine_plastics/status/1057148796654612480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 30, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>There is a lot that can be done to ensure the Our Ocean pledges don’t end up as empty promises. It’s time to ask questions about follow-up actions. NGOs can play a role, but conference organisers and hosts hold an important part of the responsibility for ensuring successful delivery of the pledges announced through their platforms. The leadership shown from the Indonesian Government on tracking delivery is a great first step but who will continue this work? Is it sustainable to expect the next government hosting the conference to take this on, or perhaps it’s time to set up an Our Ocean Conference body overseeing commitment implementation?</p>\n<p>To make these big annual conferences truly useful for driving change, there needs to be a system in place to ensure promises are followed up on with a sense of urgency. Key ocean habitats are choking on plastic, just like that boat engine during my tour of Bali’s mangrove forests. The time for empty promises is gone.</p>\n<p><em>Stay up to date with our work tackling marine plastic pollution by following FFI’s marine plastics team (@marine_plastics) on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marine_plastics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter.</a></em></p>\n",

And the fact that this is happening in a country where scientists are working under tight restrictions makes it even more amazing.</p>\n<p>Crucially, these additions to the lizard lineage are not the result of some arbitrary taxonomic reshuffle whereby existing geckos are reclassified as several separate species with the aid of molecular genetics. The new discoveries were made during recent expeditions into some of the more remote regions of Myanmar.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20193\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-20193\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/geckos-galore-myanmars-lizard-bonanza-yields-staggering-numbers-of-new-species-3.png\" alt=\"A remote karst outcrop, typical microhabitat for Myanmar's limestone-adapted geckos.

These latest finds, which are being documented in a series of peer-reviewed journal articles, provide further concrete proof that limestone ecosystems harbour extraordinary biodiversity.

Dr Grismer even named one of the new geckos – <em>Hemiphyllodactylus tonywhitteni – </em>in Tony’s honour, a fitting legacy for the man who was so instrumental in putting these neglected karst-adapted reptiles in the limelight<em>.</em></p>\n<p>It is imperative that we ensure the long-term survival of these and other limestone-dependent species by permanently safeguarding their habitat against threats such as quarrying by the cement industry.

Industrial-scale quarrying represents a serious and increasing threat to limestone environments around the world.</p>\n<p>Caves have also featured prominently throughout human history as places of shelter and as sites of religious, spiritual or cultural significance. As such, they are a magnet for pilgrims, worshippers and recreational visitors. If these caves aren’t carefully protected and sympathetically managed – for example, if lights, walkways and ventilation systems are added – the delicate balance of these ecosystems can be disrupted, and biodiversity rapidly lost.</p>\n<p>Many species found in limestone ecosystems are so precisely adapted to their habitat that they cannot withstand changes, nor can they survive outside (or travel beyond) their own small range – which can be as restricted as a single cave. The recently discovered <a href=\"http://www.fauna-flora.org/news/bugs-of-distinction-on-brink-of-extinction/\">Hon Chong ghost snail</a> is known only from two caves in Vietnam, for example, while all 15 of the <a href=\"http://www.fauna-flora.org/news/fifteen-new-gecko-species-discovered-in-myanmar/\">new gecko species</a> recently discovered in Myanmar are thought to be restricted to the individual limestone blocks where they were found.</p>\n<p>The existence of such species is already precarious, so if their habitat were degraded or destroyed, their future would be bleak – and a single misjudged blast as part of quarrying activity could wipe an entire species from the face of the Earth.</p>\n",

          "content": "<p>Today (21st November) the Scottish parliament voted to back an amendment that will ensure the effective protection of kelp from destructive harvesting. This follows a dramatic U-turn by the Scottish government yesterday, when it suddenly announced its support for an amendment that it was previously planning to vote down.</p>\n<p>All this follows four months of concerted appeals from local communities and Scottish NGOs for protection of Scottish kelp forests, in the face of a proposal for commercial kelp dredging to be undertaken in Scotland for the first time. This has involved members of the Coastal Communities Network that Fauna &amp; Flora International (FFI) has helped to facilitate and actively supports. Of particular note is Ailsa McLellan, who launched a community-led campaign (No Kelp Dredging) to challenge commercial dredging of kelp, a plant that – as a hand-harvester – she is uniquely positioned to understand.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, a group of community organisations within the network provided a coordinated response in opposition to kelp dredging proposals. In parallel, the Sustainable Inshore Fisheries Trust, a Scottish NGO with which FFI has worked closely since 2011, led a wide-reaching social media and advocacy campaign under the banner “Help The Kelp”. FFI also brought the issue to the attention of our vice-president, Sir David Attenborough. Sir David is someone who truly understands the value of kelp ecosystems, and he made a clear public statement in support of kelp protection in Scotland. His comments gained widespread media coverage across the Scottish press.</p>\n<p>Scotland holds a significant proportion of the UK’s kelp beds and the habitat is therefore considered to be nationally important. The beds are known to provide vital nursery grounds for many species of juvenile fish. They are also highly valued for their carbon storage capacity, and protecting these and other repositories of ‘blue carbon’ is essential for healthy seas and for action against climate change. In addition, kelp beds perform a critical role in coastal protection, buffering against coastal erosion and the impacts of storm damage through absorption of wave action. The targeted, wholesale removal of large, old-growth fronds from these kelp beds would substantially reduce their ability to provide these vital, free ecosystem services.</p>\n<p>Today’s vote in favour of protecting a crucial marine ecosystem was a victory for common sense. It also clearly demonstrated the value of concerted pressure, most importantly from the local communities who would suffer the direct impact of the destruction of kelp beds. There has been united opposition to kelp dredging not only among coastal communities and environmentalists, but also from the fishing industry, including creelers and trawlers, who recognise the essential role played by kelp beds as a nursery for young fish.</p>\n<p>Dr Abigail Entwistle, Director, Conservation Science &amp; Design at FFI, said: “We are delighted to see the Scottish government’s decision on this, and congratulate it for taking this positive stance for a vital component of marine biodiversity.”</p>\n",

The latest research suggests that around 70% of its mammal population has disappeared. The award-winning CLP project team is focusing its attention on Três Picos State Park and Guapiaçu Ecological Reserve, both of which lie within one of the largest remaining forest fragments. As such, they are crucial to the survival of species such as the southern muriqui, an endangered primate found nowhere else on the planet.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20089\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-20089\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/canopy-cameras-shed-new-light-on-monkey-business-in-brazil-2.png\" alt=\"Canopy camera traps have captured valuable footage of southern muriqui movements.

Serra do Mar – literally ‘mountains of the sea’ – is one of the monkey’s last remaining strongholds, but this heavily populated region includes Brazil’s two largest cities, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro; reconciling the needs and aspirations of this sea of humanity with the conservation needs of the Atlantic Forest and the species that it harbours is a delicate balancing act.</p>\n<p>Gathering data on the whereabouts, movements and population status of the remaining muriqui groups will be crucial in identifying the bottlenecks and pressure points, informing decisions about where to concentrate forest protection and restoration efforts and how best to conserve this endangered primate. The project team deployed two sets of camera traps; one of these was installed at ground level, along an altitudinal gradient rising steadily in increments of 200 metres up to 1,400 metres above sea level; the treetop traps – specifically intended to monitor muriquis – were fixed in the canopy of tree species that are known to attract these monkeys when they are in fruit.</p>\n<p>Team leader Andre Lanna won’t easily forget the long hikes to the project site: “There are no roads in this region, and so we have to walk the whole trail from the base of the mountain up to 1,400 metres and back, a total distance of over 20 kilometres. This route usually takes more than 10 hours on foot, and needs to be done for all three trails where the transects are.” Installing the canopy cameras presented a very different challenge, overcome with the aid of a researcher – Andre’s brother João – whose tree-climbing expertise and knowledge of where to place cameras to ensure the best shooting angle were critical to success.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20092\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-20092\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/canopy-cameras-shed-new-light-on-monkey-business-in-brazil-3.png\" alt=\"Tree-climbing expert João Lanna installs a camera trap in the forest canopy.

As an umbrella species, the muriqui can also play an important role in the conservation of the other Atlantic Forest species that share its habitat. The camera trap initiative has not only shed light on the monkeys’ movements and behaviour, but also revealed the presence of a long list of other mammals, from capuchins and coatis to peccaries and pumas – one of which obligingly slept in full view of a camera trap for four hours. Other, less familiar species caught on film included the tayra and lesser grison – both distant cousins of the weasel – and the evocatively named solitary tinamou, the closest living relative of the moa.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20093\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-20093\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/canopy-cameras-shed-new-light-on-monkey-business-in-brazil-4.png\" alt=\"A puma on the prowl triggers a camera trap on the forest floor.

Credit: Andre Lanna</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The southern muriqui footage is extremely important for the conservation of this primate and its threatened habitat, but Andre is well aware of the wider significance of the camera trap images that his team has succeeded in capturing: “These results show a highly preserved mammal community, quite different from almost every other place in the Atlantic Forest. This leaves us very optimistic about the future of this biome.”</p>\n<p>Among the larger mammals conspicuous by their absence were jaguar and tapir, both of which became locally extinct many decades ago. Nevertheless, the abundance of other species that were almost wiped out by hunting until conservationists intervened to protect them – and which are now thriving – suggests that these charismatic animals could also re-establish themselves here. Andre believes that this would be feasible if the Serra do Mar Ecological Corridor were extended to reconnect the project area with other surviving fragments of Atlantic Forest to the south, where jaguar and tapir still occur.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_20094\" style=\"width: 2000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-20094\" src=\"https://complex.demo/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/canopy-cameras-shed-new-light-on-monkey-business-in-brazil-5.png\" alt=\"Modern-day moa - The solitary tinamou is found only in the Atlantic Forest.
